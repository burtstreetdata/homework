I think you'll  find most of it pretty easy.

--- Practice

Make a new folder under /tmp called "chicken", with a javascript
folder under it, and an images folder also.  Don't need a css folder
for this.

Get two pictures of chickens, and put them in images.

Make index.html show one chicken.

Write a javascript function that changes
the chicken picture to the first image, and a second javascipt
fuction that changes the picture to the second image.

Put a couple buttons on the web page, "see chicken 1" and "see chicken 2"
that call the functions, so you can click a button and see the differnt
chicken.

Here's a stackoverflow article with several approaches, anything
that works is fine:
