Do problems 37-43

We will work on making an "image slider".  For now, search for "make a
custom image slider" and look at examples of what people do.  Look
thru some of the code to see get a feel for how much css, images,
javascript, and html have to bee in coordination for one dumb little
visual effect.  You don't have to do anything, but if you want to try
copying code from one of the toots in, that's fine.
