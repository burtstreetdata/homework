In the big black book, Javascript and Jquery, skim p. 44-50, which is the
end of chapter 1, and covers stuff that you are already familiar with.

Along with working on the following exercise, Read/skim chapter 2.  
Start by reading the example at the end, on page 82 and 83.  Apply what
they have to do this assignment:

Your assignment will be to make a page that has two paragraphs,
with css id of "score" and "sentiment".  Both paragraphs should be
empty, displaying no text or placeholder text.

In a javascript file, make a function that populates the paragraphs.

It will have these variables

otherteamname
otherteamscore
cubscore

Set them to whatever you like, e.g., Indians, 4, and 8.


When the function runs, the paragraphs get filled in with

   Yesterday's score: Cubs 8 Indians 4

   Yay

or

   Yesterday's Score: Cub 0 Brewers 2

   Boo

Make your index.html web page do that.  (To make the program say
anything different, you have to change the source code of the
javascript file, in "real life" it would read from a database or web
service.)

In chapter 2 of black book, they don't show you how to use an "if"
statement, but I think you already know or can check online or in
either book. You'll probably want an "if" to determine whether the
sentiment paragraph should say "Yay" or "Boo".

Look thru the books

The first 300 pages of the black book are about javascript basics, it doesn't
get to jquery until then.

The Rhino "learning javascript" book is a lot of the same material
in a less flashy style, and goes on to more advanced material.


Both of them dwell on basics for a long time, because there are a few
important basics (looping, data types, calling functions, utility text
functions) you have to be familiar with to do anything, so you mgiht find
them dull like "Learn python the hard way," but you just have to work
thru it; it has huge overlap with C#, python, and most other commonly-used
languages, so there's some extra payoff, too.
