Make a separate file in your brewers pages, in the "js" folder,
named "brewers.js".  You can leave it empty for now.

Then add this line, after the jquery </script> end tag

     <script src="./brewers.js"></script>


That will load your local file, and you can define new functions
in breweres.js.

Reload your page and look in the browser debug console, there shouldn't
be any errors.

Now put in some junk to brewers.js, like type "brewers are champs"

Reload the page, and in the web tools you should see an error about
not being able to parse that.

Now, you can write javascript in brewers.js, which can use jquery
functions.

Now, delete teh junk, and make a function called turnItRed which selects
<P> element on your page witch css id of "changeme", and makes the text
red.

And make another function, called "noBraun" that finds an <img> tag with
id of "braun" and makes it not visible.

Search on the web for how to do those things, you'll wade thru lots of
irrelevant examples.  If you read about something else that sounds interesting,
try it.

Make your existing button call "turnItRed()" when it is clicked

Make your other button call "noBraun" when it is clicked.

Add an ID of "braun" to the img tag on your page.

When you click the "noBraun" button it should make the picture disappear
(it will come back on page reload), and when you click turnItRed it should
make the  paragraph with ID of "changeme" turn red.
