Tonight we'll look at the image slider for the brewers.  No work you
have to do  today, just reading:

1.  in javascript, you work with "callback" functions all the time.
The basic idea is simple, you call a function like "populate_carousel"
and you include a function in the parameter list, say you send it
a list of pictures and function it should use to do transition effect

    populate_carousel(brewersPics, left_swipe)


That function would "call back" to  left_swipe.

In javascript, it's common to also write a function just for the purpose
of calling back, and never give that function a name.  So  you see code
like this all the time

     populate_carousel(pics, function() {
        left_pic.fade(20);
        rigt_pic.materialize(20);
        }
     }


Google for "simple explanation of callbacks" or similar language and
read thru some examples.  Callbacks are fundamental to making web pages
that  don't have to reload the full page all the time.

Also read about "javascript ajax" which is the same stuff from a different
perspective.  Look below at the function definition for "slider"  (search
for "function slider". We'll concentrate on that today.

2.  Review below, this was Monday assignment.  Make sure you have 5 pictures
all the  same size of brewers.  There are a few callbacks here, the most
striking is in the call to animate


    Gather 5 or more pictures of brewers.  Using paint, or gimp, or any online tool you want,
    scale them all to be the same size, 120 px wide and 200 px high, but whatever seems good.  We'll
    use those for a slider.  Give the files names based on uniforn number, like "brewer42.jpg" (either
    jpg or png is fine, best if  they are  all the sames)

    For each of them, also copy some basic bio text, a few sentences.  Put
    each one in a separate file, with a name based on uniform number, like "brewer42.txt".  We'll figure some way to get the bio to
    show up along with the correct picture.


    Here is the javascript I used.  These functions can go in any file in your js directory, like "slider.js"

    The page that this comes from is

    https://coderwall.com/p/vsdrug/how-to-create-an-image-slider-with-javascript

    This one is a "bare bones" version of a slider, it will be productive to understand the differences between
    this and other ones.  Eventually, I think we'll see that this is something that can be done with 5 or 6 lines
    of jquery code. 

    --------------------------

    function animate(opts){
    var start = new Date;
    var id = setInterval(function(){
    var timePassed = new Date - start;
    var progress = timePassed / opts.duration
    if(progress > 1){
    progress = 1;
    }
    var delta = opts.delta(progress);
    opts.step(delta);
    if (progress == 1){
    clearInterval(id);
    opts.callback();
    }
    }, opts.dalay || 17);
    }


    var ul;
    var liItems; 
    var imageWidth;
    var imageNumber;
    var currentImage = 1;

    function init_slider(){

    ul = document.getElementById('image_slider');
    liItems = ul.children;
    imageNumber = liItems.length;
    imageWidth = liItems[0].children[0].offsetWidth;
    // set ul's width as the total width of all images in image slider.
    ul.style.width = parseInt(imageWidth * imageNumber ) + 'px';
    container = document.getElementsByClassName('container')[0];
    let pad = parseInt($(container).css("padding-left"));
    container.style.width = parseInt(2*pad + imageWidth)+ 'px';
    slider(ul);
    }


    function slider(ul){ 
    animate({
    delay:10,
    duration: 300,
    delta:function(p){return Math.max(0, -1 + 2 * p)},
    step:function(delta){
    ul.style.left = '-' + parseInt(currentImage * imageWidth + delta * imageWidth) + 'px';
    },
    callback:function(){
    currentImage++;
    // if it doesn't slied to the last image, keep sliding
    if(currentImage < imageNumber-1){
    slider(ul);
    }
    // if current image it's the last one, it slides back to the first one
    else{
    var leftPosition = (imageNumber - 1) * imageWidth;
    // after 2 seconds, call the goBack function to slide to the first image 
    setTimeout(function(){goBack(leftPosition)},1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){slider(ul)}, 2000);
    }
    }
    });
    }

    function goBack(leftPosition){
    currentImage = 0; 
    var id = setInterval(function(){
    if(leftPosition >= 0){
    ul.style.left = '-' + parseInt(leftPosition) + 'px';
    leftPosition -= imageWidth / 10;
    }
    else{
    clearInterval(id);
    } 
    }, 17);
    }

    window.onload = init_slider;
