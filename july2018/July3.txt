Grade the problems you did last night.  There are at least two
mistakes where you can tell your answer is wrong by just reading the
problem, without doing a calculation. Focus on what they are  asking
for, not just the  numbers they state in the problem.  One you  skipped


"Simple Interest" we never talked about -- that is what  you  would
pay if you  didn't pay interest on interest.  So the  answer on that
one (4 *  (28000 * .0541)).  Do that  calculation (fine to  use
calculator or  internet).  Real interest is  always "compound" as far
as a I know -- they  say "16.99  % per year" but  they  divide 16.99
by 365, charge that amount every day, on your whole balance.  So  every
day, they charge interest on all  the interest you've  paid so far.

Start  gcloud shell, "cd" to  whatever directory your html files are
in
