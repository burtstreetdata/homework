October 15 (this is mostly a repeat from before sick week)

1.  Using a calculator/computer make a table of points for the formula below

   3*(1-x^2)^2  - 2* (1-x^2)

(you can see it formatted better at https://imgur.com/a/iecYkiV)

Figure the value of y for x these points, and write down the value of
the pairs:


x = .75
x = .77
x = .79
x = .81
x = .83
x = .85


2.  Graph those points on graph paper with pencil/pen

3.  Now go to https://www.desmos.com/ and see if you can get it to display the graph and confirm if your sketch matches pretty good.


4.  Try to run anaconda3 and see if you have it installed.  If you
do, we'll use it to confirm the values you got in step 1.
