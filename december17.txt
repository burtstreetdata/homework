Graphing

(repeat) Question to analyze:  

What is the correlation between a team's longest winning streak
in a yearnn and the total number of games the team won in a year?

Let's start by looking at total games won and longest winning
streak for each year between 1965 and 1969 for Braves, Cubs, Giants
Cardinals and Astros.

(repeat) 1.  Gather data

In a spreadsheet or anything else, get a list of games won for
each team.  To get the longest winning streak, probably the "cubstreak"
function and retrosheets logs are easiest thing to use.

Anyway, get the team, total wins (including or excluding postseason,
your choice, but consistent for each year) and longest streak for
yeach year for those 5 teams for those 5 years.


(NEW) 2.  Make a csv file out of it it, by hand or however convenient.

You can reinstall open office, or download something from microsoft
store, or just make the text file with notepad++, or search for an online
spreadsheet.

Here's a format you could copy notepad++:

Streak;Wins;Team;Year;
4;77;Astros;1965;
6;83;Astros;1966;
6;75;Astros;1967;
8;90;Astros;1968;
4;80;Cards;1965;
3;67;Cards;1966;
4;78;Cards;1967;
3;81;Cards;1968;

(part of the point of this exercise is to see, at 5 teams for 5 years,
it's tedious but doable, eventually we'll wanto to do 15 years for all
teams, we'll have to automate that)


(New) 3. Try to figure out what the bst way would be to grpah the data by hand
for just one or two teams.  What would you expect the data to look like
if there is a correlation, and would you expect it to show up for a single
team?

(REPEAT) 4.  In Tableau, make a graph (experiment with any kind of graph)
that shows the data.  You might want to multiply winning streak by
some number so that it's more visually comparable with total games --
since everyone will wind 50-100 games but most teams will only have
streaks between 4 and 10, it might make sense to multiply streaks by
10 or 11.

Just spend about 15 minutes on it unless you feel like you're making
good progress.  Then watch/read a tutorial on the basics, or see if you
can find a similar tableau graph at {google tableau viz gallery}

Later assignments, we'll gather more data, get a javascript graphing
package, and put your cubstreaks program on a web server to deliver the
data for javascript.
