This should be easy compared to yesterday:

On page 8 of the yellow book of horror, do problems 1-10.  I think you
can do it in 15 minutes or so.  But if not we'll review.

Then, read part 1 and part 2 of Factoring Quadratics:

This tutorial gives a method to factor polynomials such as you were
looking at yesterday.  It's not one I'd ever seen before but it looks
reasonable.  See if you can figure out what he means by "the box"
and apply it to one of the sticky problems from yesterday.
