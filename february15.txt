On the Humungous book, pages 530-532, there are 4 progressively
more complicated problems: 23.24, 23.25, 23.26, 23.27.

Study the way each is done - copy the
steps, verify the calculations.  Take the answers given in the book, and
plug them back into the original story problem, and verify that they
check out.

Make up two problems of your own similar to 23.27, and be ready to
grade me doing the problems (e.g., "Ron Paul eats 2.5 tacos per minute
and Larry Craig eats 3.9 tacos per minute. If Larry starts eating
tacos 10 minutes before Ron, and Ron starts at 3:25, at what time
will Larry have eaten 100 more tacos than Ron?")
