Make a   new  web page -- start by creating  c:/tmp/brewers/

Make an index.html in the folder
Make a file called about.html
Make files called batters.html, pitchers.html, fans.html, mascot.html, stadium.html
make 3 subfolders: css, js, and images
Put  a couple pictures in images
Create css/site.css, and put some rules  in it -- any dumb css from
  the tutorial is fine
Put some content in the  index.html and about.html pages, and
put links between each other (so you can click from index.html to
about.html, and vice versa).  Add small blurbs of content in each  of
the other pages, and put some links from the index page  to them, put
links  back to the index page of the other pages.

In  each  html page, have the "rel" link to the style sheet.


Put <img> tags in both  pages using some of the pictures

You can copy  from your existing sites.  Run your web server software,
and browse to http://localhost/brewers
