Starting with "Scratchpage" as a template

Try the tutorial at https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-sprites.php
again, modifying the pages.  This is an all-css technique.

Take one of your own pictures, edit it in gimp or some other
tool to reduce it to greyscale, and make it that when your mouse
goes over the picture, it changes colors.

It's probably vital to this technique that the photo be a link, because
I don't know if an <img> tag on itself has any property like
"onHover".  But there is a simpler class that does buttons which
does.

Here is a demo about making buttons change color:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_transition_hover.asp

Make some buttons on a web page that change color like that.

Then read this one:

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_snackbar.asp

And finally, combine them, make a couple buttons that have "snack bar"
messages and also turn colors when you move over them.

Browse thru the effects on the sidebar of those pages.  Try out
any that interest you.  

Search google for html tables/table css styling, and use a table
to set up a 9 inning home/away table with css.

Make a new webpage called "innings.html" in the  same directory
as index.html.  Use the same style sheet in the <head> element,
or make a new stylesheet (e.g. innings.css) as you prefer; but
if you make a new one, keep it in the css directory.

Once you have it done, commit the new web page to the homework
repository.  (read how to do it with git commmand line tool and run
git from ubuntu).  Update the css, or add your new css file.
