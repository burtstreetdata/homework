Cross multiplying:  (4 problems)

      solve for x using cross multiplying -- problems 13-15 on page 151

"Cross multiply" means, for example on problem 2 on that page,
7 * (-x-1) = -8 (-3x -9)

THe problems I gave you don't involve cases where you wind up
with x squared -- After you've finished 13-15, try problem 8, again
by cross-multiplying.  Once you have the resulting polynomial, you
might have to factor to get the solution(s) for x.
