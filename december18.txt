Get more data of rows to graph

1.  Figure out how to write to a csv, here's one example:

https://realpython.com/python-csv/#writing-csv-files-with-csv

You would want to write out something like

  filewriter.writerow(['NYY', 1995, 4, 81])

for New york, 1995, 4 streak, 81 wins.

2. Now write a loop to get more data -- adjust the abbreviation
of the teams to be correct, here is pseudo code:

   open a csv writer
   for each team in ['CHN', 'SLN', 'HAN', 'ALN']
      for year in range(1965:1970)
        filename = '/TMP/GL' + str(year) + '.TXT'
        streak = cubstreak(team, year)
	   filewriter.writerow(team, year, streak)

(you'll have to play around with that filename syntax, test it with
print loops, make sure all the game logs are in the same directory)

That should make a file with the streak in it.  Then edit the file
with notepad++ to put in the wins per years.  If you can figure out a way
to have the loop put in number of wins of course that's better but
I don't know any convenient syntax.

3.  In tableau, read the file.  Here is my idea, I think the streak
length should be the x axis, and be discrete vaues -- one column for
3 wins, one for 4... up to 25 or whatever is longest in the sample.

Then the "marks" should show either the average of wins, or, what I
can't figure out how to do, one dot representign each
team+year+numberOfWins for each season.  So if a team had 9 win streak
and won 99 games, tehre should be one mark on the 9 win "column" with
a mark at 99 on the y axis for that team.

Another thing that wold be good is if 5 teams who had 9 games streaks
won 99 games, that dot should be bigger (example sketch).  I am
leaving some sketches of what I have in mind, see if you can figure
out how to do them
