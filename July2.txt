Make some changes to the page we uploaded to wings.owlcookfoul.com/fish,
and  re-upload them there. Just add some text about how to earn money
selling older meat products at minor league parks or something similar.

Continue to work on the  bootstrap tutorial, go at your own pace, and
add some different features.

Try to add a separate page to wings, with a link from fish.html to your
new page.
