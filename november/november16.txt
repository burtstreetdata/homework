Nov 16:

Make a roster dataframe that has multiple players for some
position.

Make an empty dictionary.

Loop thru the dataframe, using a "for" or "while" loop,
and poulate the dictionary with the name of the position
and the highest batting average for that position found.

E.g. if your rosster looked like

Position     Bavg
C	     220
C	     235
LF	     314
RF	     232
RF	     333
C	     680

Your dictionary should have

C 680, RF 333, LF 314

One  algorithm: for every row in the dataframe, if there isn't
a dictionary entry for that position, get the row's Bavg and add it.
If there is such  a key, get the row's Bavg, compare it to the value
already in the dictionary, and if it's higher, add it.
