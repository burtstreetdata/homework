First, this is a repeat of yesterday:


We looked at a way to make a very simple graph, with one un-labeled
line, for a set of x-y coordinates.

First assignment:  memorize these steps, how to make  a simple
graph

      1.  import pyplot from matplotlib
      2.  make two equal-length arrays with x & y coordinares
      3.  call pyplot.plot() with the two arrays as arguments

Make a graph of

xs = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
and
ys = [2,4,9,12,20,24,35,40,54,60]

It should make a line that goes up, steeper and steeper as it goes.


Seond assignment:


Go back to the "Loop" section in part 7: 

    https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/

One of the things that comes up a lot in any programming
language is looping thru all the members of lists, or looping
til some condition turns true or false.

First, read all the questions on section 8, "Remix".  Don't
try to do them yet.

Make a new Python notebook, called "Loops7".  Come back and do all the
examples on exercise 7, Loops (type the code into a jupyter notebook
and run it, don't just cut and paste).  Just get them to run, and save
what you try in the notebook if it doesn't work.

Again, it's  okay if you want to use the silver computer with "Danny"
account, it is faster for Anaconda Nav.
