Using a text editor such as notepad++, Change the text file,
c:\TMP\roster.txt, to add two new columns,batting average and
position.  Add a few players and fill out some real or made
up data.

In python, import it into a dataframe.

Make another text file, roster_dodgers.txt.  Change it to Dodgers
names, averages, etc.

Read it into a dataframe.

--- The rest of this, you might not be able to complete

Goal: Want to write a function that gets the name of every player
on  a roster with a batting average greater than some certain amount.

Google "looping thru pandas dataframe".

Write a function that takes two arguments, battingAverage, and
roster.  The "roster" argument will be one of the two dataframes
you created above.  battingAverage is a minimum batting average.

Make the function print the names of every player in the roster
with a batting average over what was passed in.  

Use the red-weasel python book, chapter 5, about pandas, and google,
to figure out how to read lines of a dataframe and compare the batting
average to the argument.
