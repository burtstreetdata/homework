On page 503, do all the odd-numbered problems, but skip 19, and add in 16.

Any that you don't know how to do, write "not covered".



About problems 16 and 17:   I couldn't remember last night, here is how:

Say you have "The line that has slope 4 and contans 2,3.  Then you
know it's

     y=mx+b

and m is 4 so

    y=4x+b

and you know (2,3) is on the line:

    3=4*2+b

So from that you can get b. . . and get perhaps -5, then you know
b= -5, and y = 4, so  . . . .

   y=mx+b
   y=4x-5

So you should be able to solve problem 17 like that and 16 is similar,
you get the slope and use either of the two points as above to find the
y intercept
