Part I

On page 163 of workbook, do problems 1-8.

This is systems of linear equations -- You can use either substitution
or adding/subtracting equations.

Check your answers in back of book and circle any in the workbook
that you got wrong.

Part II

In python -- start Anaconda (you might want to do that before you do
the workbook, Anaconda takes so long), and make a new workbook called
"syseq".

Write a function called "cows", that takes one argument, x, and
returns (5x + 3)/6

Write a second function, "horses", that takes one argument, x,
and returns (2x + 7)/6

I think the functions, horses and cows, correspond to the two
equations in problem 1 from the workbook.  See if, when you give them
both the value of x you got for the answer to problem 1, the two
functions return the same value.
