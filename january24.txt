* Remembet to say "isolate y" if I ask you how do you rewrite an equation like
this: 5x + 3y = 18 into the form y = mx+b?

* If you have an equation Ax + By = C, you can isolate y by subtracting
Ax from both sides and then diving both sides by B -- so the equation
becomes

	y = (C - Ax) / B

That can be rewritten

        y - C/B - Ax/B

And what's important about that?  It gives you the slope of the line --
namelye (-1)*(A/B)

For example --   2x + 5y = 9

         y = (9 - 2x) / 5

	 y = 9/5 - (2/5) x

So the slope is -2/5.  And the y-interecept is 9/5... aka 1 4/5

------

Go thru the above step-by-step with 3 other constants, e.g. 4,6 and 7,
in any order.  After you got the slope, graph the equation as desmos.com.
One thing to note is that whenever A and B are positive the slope is negative.

On page 171 of the yellow book, solve any three of the systems of equations,
using either substitution or elimination.  Verify the results by graphing
at desmos.com.  If you have any errors, work back thru the arithmetic
and find where.
