1. Repeat: Write a program that uses python globbing and prints out
the names of every file in c:/tmp that starts with "s".  Put some
files in there that start with s and run again, confirm it got them.

------------------------------------

2.  repeat, but do this again.  Write a function that reads
c:/tmp/roster2018 file and counts jus the lines that say "None" for
image.


-----

3.  search web for "python parse comma delimited" and "python string
intepretation"

Write a function that gets every line where the last name begins
with Y or Z AND has "None" for image. For each line, print out

     MLB Player <firstname> <Lastname> image

We could use that as input to make a web search for images of those
players


----------
4.  Try running the program below, this uses a special library for handling
csv files:

import csv
columns = ['id', 'last_name', 'first_name', 'photo']
with open("c:/tmp/roster2018.txt", "r") as roster :
    reader = csv.DictReader(roster, fieldnames=columns, skipinitialspace = True)
    for r in reader :
        if 'None' in r['photo']  and r['last_name'][0] == 'Q':
            print(r)

You can use "csv" module to get files ready for presenting
in a program like tableau.  It can also write csv files --

read: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

Just browse thru, concentrating mostly on the examples

-----

5. Download some csv data about anything, and try reading it and
creating a graph with tableau. You can use web tutorials or whatever
resource you want.

------------

6.  There are a couple github projects if you google "python
retrosheet", look around at those and see if either seems more
lively/interesting.
