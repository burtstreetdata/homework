Memorize the quadradic formula

------

In your notebbook, I did an exampe plugging in the values for
   1/3 x^2  - 4 x - 8 = 0

Search google for "desmos Quadratic formula graph" and you can
enter in that formula and it will show you the graph.  You can see
it intercepts x axis (x == 0) at around 13 and around -2.



The quadratic formua dosn't work when b^2 - 4ac is less than zero.
So if a or c (but not both) is negative, it always works, beccause
you subtract a negative, and can always get the square root.


-------------

Solve the equation below using th quadratic formula.  You can
use a caculator to get square roots and otherwise reduce tedium.

     2 x^2  + 8x + 5 = 0   ("two x squared plus eight x plus 5")
