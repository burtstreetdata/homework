Tableau -- watch the 5 minute video about "understanding the logic
of charts" on https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources

You can watch any of the others there, also.

Go back to the sample we were working on and see if you can figure out
how to get the lines between data points.  Even if not, see if you can
get to the point of being able to easily (fluently) make the chart
from scratch, starting with a blank sheet, importing the .csv file,
and making FIP and ERA have different marks (triangle for FIP and
cirle for ERA) on a dual axis chart.

Spend most of the hour on that.

Trig

Look at the unit circl interactive thing on mathisfun, or anyhwere else.
Choose some arbtrary point on the circle, and get th sine and cosine
of the point.  In a calculator, find out if sine squared + cosine squared
is = 1.

Python

See if you can get python to print out just the 2nd column of your turkey.csv
file (parse and print a csv file)
