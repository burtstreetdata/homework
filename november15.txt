Load two dataframes, one for cubs and one for dodgers.

Write a function that gets the name of every player on a roster with a
batting average greater than .250 (or 250 if you entered them as numbers).

Change the function to take an argument instead of being hard-coded
to 250 (make it an argument)

Make another function that prints out the name of every player who
plays Catcher (or some other position in the cubs, then do it for the
dodgers.

Try to find a way to get a list of all the positions in a roster,
e.g., if you only 4 people in a roster with two pitchers, one
shortstop, and one ph, it would get an array like ['P', 'SS', 'PH']
(however you spelled/abbreviated them).  It doesn't have to be an
array.  You might google for "how to get all the values in a column
of a dataframe".
