1.  Watch this  video:

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-system-of-equations/systems-overview-alg/v/how-many-bags-of-potato-chips-do-people-eat

This shows you a realistic realworld example of using Sytems of Equations.

I am going to tell you the same story tonight and have you write
the equations out.

2.   In Structure and Method book, on page 432, do problems

10, 13, 16, and 19.

When have the answer, plug them back into original equation and make sure
the equations are true.


3.  Look at problem 22 on same page... you don't have to solve it, but you'll
see 22, 23 and 24 are all similar.  You'll get those tomorrow.

4.  Graphing
We gave graphing short shrift last year but will remedy it by overkill
this year.

Do problems 14, 20, 26 and 29 on page 368.  Read the material on previous
pages if any question -- you want to get the equations to y=mx+b form
before proceeding.  There is graph paper in the math cubby.
