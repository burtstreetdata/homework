Sept 25

In Algebra book from last year, read page 426, and follow
along with the examples.  These are examples of equations one
step easier than the ones we worked on last night, so it will
probably be easy.

On page 427, under Written Exercises

Do 1, 4, 7, and 10

On page 429, in section B, do problems 6 and 7


-----------------

Now read page 430, you don't have to do any of the problems
yet, but you should see it's similar to what we were looking
at last night
