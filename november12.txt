We looked at a way to make a very simple graph, with one un-labeled
line, for a set of x-y coordinates.

First assignment:  memorize these steps, how to make  a simple
graph

      1.  import pyplot from matplotlib
      2.  make two equal-length arrays with x & y coordinares
      3.  call pyplot.plot() with the two arrays as arguments

Make a graph of

xs = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
and
ys = [2,4,9,12,20,24,35,40,54,60]

It should make a line that goes up, steeper and steeper as it goes.


Seond assignment:


Go back to:

Jump right to section 7, and work thru the examples.

Write a function that takes an array as an argument, and returns
a new array where the values are the squares of the first argument.

E.g. if you name your function "yankee", then if you type

     square_me = [2,3,6,10, -1]
     i_am_square = yankee(square_me)

Then i_am_square will have the values [4, 9, 36, 100, 1]

3.  Graph the result of your function using pyplot using the
steps above.  E.g., if you used the names above, run

      
     pyplot.plot(square_me, i_am_square)

Try it both ways, that is, also run

     pyplot.plot(i_am_square, square_me)

4.  Browse in the red python Data Analysis book, the 
chapter about pandas, that is, chapter 5.  Don't worry about
understanding it all but see if you can follow along, type
in some of the examples.

When you start Anaconda Navigator, make sure the "Base" environment
has pandas installed.  If it doesn't search for "pandas" in
the Anaconda Navigator "search packages" and  install
it.

It's okay if you want to use the silver computer, I confirmed anaconda
nav. will run under Danny account and it's got pandas
