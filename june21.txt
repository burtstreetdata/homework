Create a new folder under tmp, tmp/css, call it site.css

In that, put an external style sheet.

Change the <link....>
       to     <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/site.css">

Work thru the examples on quackit, make sticky things, change them
from left to right, etc.  

Upload your site.css to github, in the homework repository
