Create a new folder under tmp, tmp/css, call it site.css

In that, put an external style sheet.

Change the <link....>
       to     <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/site.css">

Work thru the examples on quackit, make sticky things, change them
from left to right, etc.  You can rush thru it but try everything once.

Keep your css in a separate stylesheet (not inline/imbedded, like the examples)


Upload your site.css to github, in the homework repository.  You can
upload multiple versions as you go along -- with git, each time you
upload it, that version is preserved, but the most recent version is
the default one.   -- If you get stuck uploading it to homework repository,
don't worry about it, we'll get it tonight, give up after 8 minutes of
trying.

Now, follow this tutorial for sprites.  This is something you'd likely
want to use in greater/lesser bumdom.

Make an identical or similar picture swapper.

Then do a search for "sprite animation", find some example you'd
like to learn.
