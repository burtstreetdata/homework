In your  by creating  c:/tmp/brewers/index.html, load the jquery
library.  You do this by putting this tag just before the end of the html
body -- your page should look have



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ....stuff in head
  </head>
  <body>
  ...... stuff in body
  </body>
</html>

It will work to put javascript libraries almost anywhere after html, but
people usually put at bottom of page, just before </body>

So stick this tag in there:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>


------------

Now you can put jquery code on your page!  But it only works for that
one page -- for pages like "mascot.html", "crybaby.html" -- the same
thing has to go before </body> in every page.  (It will also work if it's
inside <head></head> tags)

-----

If you load your page you should see no difference yet.

Now, in text editor, put a button on your page that calls a function called "turnItRed", and make a
<P> element on your page witch css id of "changeme"

YOu should see the button when you look at the page, but it won't do
anything yet.  You have to create a function that turns the paragraph
red, and make the button call that function when clicked.

Your goal is to have the button to turn the paragraph red when you click it.

Search for "jquery change color"  and "how to make a html button run code".

You've done one web page before where presseing a button made an alert
pop up; this could be done in a similar way.  There are many ways to
do it, and what you read will be confusing.  Try different things.
Use the web browser's script console to figure it out.  You mgiht want
to browse a few pages of the w3schools jquery tutorial.
