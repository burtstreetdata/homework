I think last night was close, the problem in that in the url, you
have  to have the relative path to the image, RELATIVE TO THE STYLESHEET.

Change the .css sheet like this:

	background-image:url(../images/dw-logo-sprite.jpg);

That  ".." means "next level up", so it's getting the file in the
images "sibling" subdirectory of the css directory.

That worked on mine, if it's still not working on yours we'll look
for difference tonight

Choose any of these items below, do as much as you want.

ONE

Take one of your own pictures, edit it in gimp or some other tool to
reduce it to greyscale, save it as a jpeg.  Then, to use his
technique, you have to make a single jpg that has the two images side
by side -- in gimp, you'd create a new image, make the canvas width
twice the original picture, and same height.  Copy in the regular and
grayscale pictures as layers, arrange them, export the jpg, put it
in your images directory, and adapt the sizes/url of his css to match
yours.

TWO

In homework repository there is a subdirectory called bbdata.  copy the
scripts to your disk.  Use python from unix (or do activity three and use from windows).

From unix:
   $ cd /mnt/c/whereveryouputpythonfiles
   $ python box_score_v1.py

You need the secretfile (that has the password) where python can find
it, the script says
    	with open("/tmp/bbpwd.txt") as secretfile:

If I had you put that in c:\tmp, and you're running from UNIX, you'd
change that part of the script to say 

       with open("/mnt/c/tmp/bbpwd.txt")

If you get the script to work, look around at https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/,
the MLB api has a ton of other stats you can pull down.  See what ones are


THREE

Download/setup free version of pycharm, it's an IDE for python.


FOUR

Use html tables and css to create a baseball scoreboard (search the internet
for ideas)


FIVE

Look at what's available on mysportsfeeds.com and identify stats that
what would be relevant to greater/lesser bumdom page.  We can get
live data with a three minute lag.
