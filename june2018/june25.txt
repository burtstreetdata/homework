Get the repository "scratchPage" from our git site onto your computer, have
it  land in c:\tmp\scratchPage.  From Ubuntu, that  directory is called
/mnt/c/tmp, and you want  to make /mnt/c/tmp/scratchPage

First, try this in ubuntu

cd  /mnt/c/tmp
git clone https://github.com/burtstreetdata/scratchPage.git

if that works, you'll  have them in c:\tmp\scratchPage.git

--------------  if that  doesn't work, figure something out from
git desktop or the github website, get  the project on your
computer.   In the long run the unix command  line one is easiest
to work with.


You'll notice that the javascript, images, and css are each in
their own directory.

Since your web browser points at c:\tmp\, you will have to
browse to "localhost:/scratchPage/" -- that will make it look
from c:\tmp\scratchPage\index.html

The images aren't in the git repository, download any three
images, put them in c:\tmp\scratchPage\images\, give them names
that match the index.html file.

So that page is an example of how javascript and css work.  Try
the tutorial at https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-sprites.php
again, modifying the pages

Get from github the "extra" assignment from Friday.  In any kind
of web page, play around with creating an "innings" scoreboard that
looks attractive -- play with borders, padding, fonts, colors.
You can search the web and see if there are gui css layout designers,
feel  free to try them out, either install on your comuter or they
might run online.

Not Math, but:

Split the megablocks however you like.  Get a bunch pictures, either
on phone or on camera is fine.  I recommend making the pictures
different -- in one, build a tower, in one sort them by colors,
just make sure it's easy for us to tell what "batch" of blocks
each picture is showing.  As illogical as it is, things will sell
better with more pictures, and you can do things like show the
different block sizes next to a quarter, you can show a picture
of 5 of them being weighed on a scale -- quirky makes people remember
the post.
