June 22, days getting shorter on this tutorial:

     https://www.w3schools.com/jS/default.asp

It shows you how to use "raw" javascript to do basic effects.
In real applications, you use fancy libraries of javascript that
shorten the syntax and have bundled composite effects, like
crawling text, fades, throbbing, etc.

This tutorial will introduce you to the underlying mechanism those
libraries use.

Starting with the web page you made that has a .js file already, in
which you can add code, try the examples both in your local web page
and in the tutorial's "try it now" section.

Combining what homework from last three days, here's an assignment:
	  make a paragraph of text that has an id of "switcher"
	  use css to make that paragraph have a green background
	  use javascript so that when your mose is over switcher, the paragraph
	  changes to some other color, for example yellow or light gray

	  Try to upload the .css and .js files up to the homework repository
