Skip forward in the bootstrap tutorial to read the exercises:

https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_tables.asp

At the bottom of the page, there are Exercises.  Just read the exercises,
don't try them yet, the point is to get a feeling for what kind of questions
they ask in the exercises.  Then read thru the "BS Grid Basic","BSTypography"
and "BS Tables" pages, and then try the exercises.

You don't have to load them on your computer, you can do the exercises
in the editor that w3schools shows you.

Now, start thinking, how can you use bootstrap tables to structure a simple
"bum" / "not a bum" page?  What should such a page display?

Have a look at the page on "BS Images".  Grab a couple images of
baseball players and try to layout a table showing them side by side
in a bootsrtap grid, with some junk text underneath them listing
factors.  Try anyhting you want.
