In big red book:

Review: page 670-671

In the four problem sets on pages 670-671, so problems 3 and 5 in
each problem set; total of 8 problems.

  * On the last problem set, I think the problems might all be
factoring, if they are, I'm more interested in seeing the problem get
set up as an equation like ax^2+bx+c=0 than the actual solution; we'll
come back to hard factoring later.

  * If you find you've already done 3 in one of the problem sets,
do problem 6
