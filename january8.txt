Trig

Warm up:

On this page, abouout 3/4 of the way down, is a drawing of the
unit circle with all the notations that app uses:

     https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/unit-circle.html


The picture is just below the text "Note that cos is first and sin is
second, so it goes (cos, sin):"

Looking at the picture, so you can get 100% if you don't fumble-finger,
run thru the app once.

---------------------------------

Take a break from Trig, go back to tableau.  Try to download this
workbook:

https://public.tableau.com/profile/owenhwatson#!/vizhome/ERAFIPStartingPitchingStaffsEntireSeasonMLB2015/Dashboard1

From the "download workbook" button.  Look at the data sheets, and
see if you can get data in the same format for some 2018 teams, and
change the graph to show those.

Spend 30 minutes or so on this.


-------------------

Back to trig, without referring to the graph, try running the app for
3 minutes or so, take your time, don't rush or make yourself complete it.
We'll look at for 3 or 4 days before the pieces come together.
