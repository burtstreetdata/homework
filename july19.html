Now you have your .css in a file, and you've linked to it.

Your gave script is in a file, but you haven't linked to it yet.
You have to give the correct filename in a script tag, if it is
brewers.js, in subdirectory js, you'd put this in index.html, just before
the </body> end-of-body tag:

 <script src="./js/brewers.js"></script>


 In the javascript file, at the end, cut this part:
       window.onload = init_slider;

 and on your index.html, just after the script mentioned above, before </body> tag, put in


<script>window.onload = init_slider;</script>

That means that window is loaded, it will call a function named
"init_slider".  "window" is an object, "onload" is a property/member
variable.  The function it calls, init_slider, is defined in the
file that will be loaded by the first script line.

Now your page probably is doing something with the pictures when it
loads but it doesn't look right.

If it's not doing anything, go to developer tools, console, see if it
has any error message and if you can figure it out.

If it's doing something but looks funny:

You have to set the container .css to be correct.  If your picture is
250 x 275, you have to make the .css file say the width is 290 -- that
is the size of the image plus 2 * the size of the padding -- look at
Booers.css -- width is what you have to change.  Mine looks like this
because my picture is 109 wide and 82 tall:

.container{
    width:149px;
    height:122px;
    padding:20px;
    border:1px red;
    -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;
    -moz-box-sizing:border-box;
    box-sizing:border-box;
    background: black; 
}
