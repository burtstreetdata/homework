Look at the graph on page 108-109 of Python for Data Science, and
try typing in the commands to make it go.  If it doesn't work, don't
worry about it, go on with below.

-------

The stuff above uses a lot of python syntax.  Go back and browse thru
page 85-108.  Try typing in some of the examples, try your own
variants, etc.  Lots of data analysis involves rows and columns of
numbers, and the np.array gets used a lot.  As you read, do the below:

Quiz:

1.  Create an numpy array x, so that if you type print(x) it prints

[[0 1]
 [2 3]
 [4 5]
 [6 7]]

2.  Use a "slice" operator on the array created above
to make a new array, newx, such that if you run "print(newx)"
you get
        [[2 3]
	 [4 5]]

3.  Use the reshape command to make an aray from x, named
flatx, such that "print (flatx)" returns:

    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]


Finally, after you've read 85-108 and done problems above, skim
thru the preceding chapter.  They give a quick review of some important
parts of python.  Without a bunch of useless nonsense no one uses.
