1 Graphing

a.  Draw a graph of a line with slope  3 that has a negative y
intercept.   Write the equation of the line


b.  Change the following two equations to "y = mx+b" format and graph them
both on one set of coordinats, so they will intercept:

       	 3y - 6 = x
	 8y - 2x = 24

c.  At what point do the two lines in b intercept?  You can use a
calculator, you don't have to use the graph, but the answer should
look plausible when related to the graph


d.  Suppose we call the line with the smaller slope "the less steep
line" or LSL, and the other one "the more steep line" or MSL.  If LSL
became a little steeper, but the lines still intercept, would the x
coordinate of the intercept point be greater or smaller?  Suppose on
the other hand the MSL became a little steeper -- would the x
coordinate of the intercept point be greater or smaller?

2.  Word problems

Make a system of equations out of both the word problems below and
solve

a) Kristin spent $131 on shirts.  Fancy shirts cost $28 and plain
shirts cost $15.  If she bought a total of 7 then how many of each
kind did she buy?  (Hint: you should have two variables, one is
number of fancy shirts, one is number of plain shirts. You can get
two different equations from the facts given, those two equations
make your system of equations)


b) There are 13 animals in the barn.  Some are chickens and some are
pigs.  There are 40 legs in all.  How many of each animal are there?
(Hint, as above, you should have two variables and two different
equations)

c) The drama club sells hot chocolate and coffee at the high school
football games.  At the last game, they had sales of $200.  They need
to keep track of how many of each type drink was sold so that they can
make predictions for future sales.  Monica knows that they used 275
cups that night.  If the hot chocolate sells for 75 cents and coffee
sells for 50 cents, how much of each type of drink were sold?
