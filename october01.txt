Graphing

a.  Draw a graph of a line with slope  3/5 that has a negative y
intercept.   Write the equation of the line


b.  Change the following two equations to "y = mx+b" format and graph them
both on one set of coordinats, so they will intercept:

       	 y/2 - 1 = 1.5 x
	 .5y - 1.2 x = 1

c.  At what point do the two lines in b intercept?  You can use a
calculator, you don't have to use the graph, but the answer should
look plausible when related to the graph

d.  Go to Desmos website and paste those formulas in, you should
see the graph matches your answer.


2.  Word problems

Make a system of equations out of both the word problems below and
solve

A.  Ben took the most recent year that the cubs won the World Series
and broke it into two two-digit numbers, a and b.  The sum of a was
36 and the difference of b-a was 4.  What were the two number, and
in which year did the coobs win the world series?
