Today's assignment is mostly reading.  Read sections 13.1 thru 13.9 of
humongous book of algebra problems (276-278).  For 13.6 thru 13.9 (4
of them) write one similar problem for each, and those will be for me
to do, and you to tell me if my answer is right.

E.g. for problem 13.7 you could say "get the 4th root of 188".  Try to
choose number that I will actually have work to do.  For example,
don't have me get the root of a prime number.
