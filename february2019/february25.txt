Repeat from Friday:

Range -- On page 379 of the red book, read the text.  The arrow
notation they talk about for functions you might never see outside
of a math class, but the "P(n)" notation for functions should
remind you of computer programming functions.

On page 380, do problems 1-7; check your answers in the back of the book.  (reminder, one of the problems has
a funny stray letter in front of the {, I beliee that is s typo.

Word Problems:

On page 329, chose any three problems from section "B" (13-20) and solve
them.

They aren't straight RTD problems or "work" or "mixture" problems.  At
least write down the variables for something you're trying to get, and
write some equations.  

With most of these, they are a combination of two problems, one that
is simpler: e.g., #15, you have to break it into two jobs -- one where
you know the amount of time is 1 hour and have to figure the combined
rate, and from that figure how much they do in an hour.  Then, you
have the remaining amount of the cornfield as the amount, you know the
rate, and have to figure out the time.

As you said on Friday, in a lot of these they don't explicitly state the
amount, it is implicit "1" for the whole thing, e.g., 1 Field, one Tank,,
one swimming pool, 1 job.
