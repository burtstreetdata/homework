More practice on systems, these should have whole number solutions:

Tonight we will have a test doing 2 randomly-chosen systems of equations
problems from the yellow book, so review anything you need to.  I know
you have the concepts of sustitution/elimination mastered, it's the
simplification arithmetic you need to have more reliable, mostly working
with distributing multiplication/division over expressions with fractions
and being careful with signs.

Today, for homework, do problems 1 thru 5 on page 82, factoring.  Remember,
once factored to an answer like (3x-5)(2x+2) = 0, you still have to get
the values for x (5/3 and -1 in that example).
