GIT

read this quiz -- you won't know the answer to most, maybe not any, of
the questions -- focus on paying attention to the terminology, the
questions are using the correct git terminology

https://niksilver.com/2013/08/20/git-quiz/

Read thru the first 3 pages of

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
(section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3), fairly carefully.  You can/should create
repositories on your computer to follow along with some of the
commands.  When you're done, you can delete the repositories/directories
they are in.

Then look at the quiz again, see if any of  hte questions that
didn't make sense before now do.


-------------------

BOOTSTRAP

Make a new directory under /mnt/c/tmp with a three- or four-character
name that's easy to type, such as "poot", "tent", "mask", "abc", etc.

Start doing the bootstrap toot at:

      https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp

When it talks about "Downloading Bootstrap", you don't have to do that,
you'll use "Bootstrap CDN"

Work thru the first two pages of the tutorial, then skim the
third page (Bootstrap grids).  Create web pages in the new
directory you created

Basically, you'll just be putting  some stuff (bootstrap/jquery
and .css referernces) in the <HEAD> part of a document.

We can deploy it to the internet tonight and look at it on the phone.
Or if you want to try on your own, here  are all the notes I kept
about uploading.  If you try it, don't worry about hitting  error messages,
read them and try to see  what  they mean, google them if they don't
make sense, that's completely normal when doing  this stuff:

Start the gcloud shell from start menu

cd into your website directory

Run this command:


	gcloud compute scp index.js burtstreetdata@turkey:/srv/www/turkey/index.js
