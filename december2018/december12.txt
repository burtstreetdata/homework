Take a break from python for a bit and go back to javascript

See if you start nginx from Ubuntu, if you browse to http://localhost/brewers

In your tmp directory, under "brewers", I think there's some pages,
just review what's there.  Look for any work you did using bootstrap
and try to find those pages (search the web for "how to find text in
files windows 10" or something if you can't find it.  Probably the pages
are in /tmp or a subdirectory of tmp

Vague, self-guided assignment:

Try to write a page with some javascript that does anything, just find
an example on the web of coloring text or something, and see if you
can make it work.

 * Javascript will only work when it is served by a web browser
 * don't use inline javascript, put it in a file
 * use previous pages you created to avoid setting up all new directories
