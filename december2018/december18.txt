Summary: Today's assignment is to get the program we were working on
last night to work to print out csv files with the strreak of each
team for the year range.

Details:

First run what we wrote last night, and review what it's doing so far.
It's just printing out the arguments it generates, not actualy
calling cubsstreak or writing out to a CSV yet (except maybe one junk
row)

1. Get all the game log files for 1965 thru 1969 in c:\tmp.  After
you unzip them, you have to move the unzipped .txt files up a level.
The logs have to be all in the same directory.

2. Change the code (you might want to copy what you have to start with
somewhere in case it gets messed up in editing).  In the loop, call
cubstreak, and get the streak for the current team:

	streak = cubstreak(filename, team)

Then assign stuff to a list:

        row = [team, year, streak]

and write the row to the csv

    	  gamewriter.writerow(row)

Note -- in the cells above your loop, you have to have run the code
to define "cubstreak" -- it needs to be redefined each time you start
Anaconda.  

Get the program to work to write all the streaks for each team/year
    combination.  Once you confirm it's working, study it a bit, and try
to rewrite it from scratch, in a new workbook.  For tonight, I'll
want to see you write out the program, it probably comes up to 12 lines or
so.

Note also: "gamewriter", I chose that name, it's a poor choice that
confuses the program.  Call the csvwriter something that reflects what
it is writing.  Again, choosing good vabiable names is important.
You can use a variable name like "f" for something that you're using
once within a couple lines, otherwise you should spend time to choose
a name that describes what the program is doing.
