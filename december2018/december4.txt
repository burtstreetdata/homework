Download some gamelogs from retrosheet, and put them in c:\tmp.




Do the assignment from November 30-- write a function that creates
a list of all the teams in a file. Only add a team to the list if
it isn't already in the list.    It shoul give different teams for
long-ago seasons.


Below is the logic you wrote last night, you can adapt it to
write and test this assignment.

-----------------------------------


import glob as glob
s= glob.glob ('c:/tmp/gl*txt')
    
def get_it(filename) :
    i=0
    with open (filename) as file:
        for g in file.readlines():
            i+=1
            fields=g.split(",")
            atm,htm = (fields[3],fields[6])
            asc,hsc = (fields[9],fields[10])
            dt= (fields [0])
            if i%88==0:
                print (dt + atm + asc + ' ' + htm + hsc)
                
for season in s:
    #print (line + 'is a logfile')
    get_it(season)
