December 11 -- Finish this up:


Using python --  Get the team with the longest winning streak in any given
file.

       def longest_streak("gl2001.txt")

Should come back with ("SEA", 15) (or whatever the right answer is).

Your code should use two other functions you write.  One is to get
the winning streak for a specific team, you have the heart of that function
from last night at:

https://github.com/burtstreetdata/homework/blob/master/ass/homeork1210.ipynb

You have to paraterize that function to make it take a team as an
argument.

Then you have to write a function (or find one you wrote previously) that
will get a list of teams from a Log file.  Remember that when you
add strings to the list, you have tp strip off the " and you have to
check if a team is already in the list before adding.


Finally, you will tie them tother with something like this
(pseudo code)

longest_yet = 0
streaking_team = ""
teams = teams_in_file(the_file)
for t in teams :
    strk= get_streak(the_file, t) 
    if strk > longest_yet :
        longest_yet = strk
	streaking_team = t
return(longest_yet, streaking_team)
