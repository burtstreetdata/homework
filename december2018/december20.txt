Homework


Happy birthday.... pseudocode only today

1. Be able to give the pseudo code for creating the csv file we were
working on.


2.  Suppose you have a function called "succeeded()" that returns
"YES" 90% of the time and "NO" 10% of the time.  Give me pseudo code
for a a function that calls succeeded() 14 times.  Each time
succeeeded() returns "NO", your function starts trying again on
attempt number 1, trying to get 14 in a row.  When it gets 14 in a row
it prints "Got 14 in a row on 2032 tries".

This is a simulation of trying to blow out 14 candles on one breath,
and someone relights all the candles if any don't go out.  So it
is science.
