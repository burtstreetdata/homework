Graphing

Question to analyze:

What is the correlation between a team's longest winning streak
in a year and the total number of games the team won in a year?

Let's start by looking at total games won and longest winning
streak for each year between 1965 and 1969 for Braves, Cubs, Giants
Cardinals and Astros.

1.  Gather data

In a spreadsheet or anything else, get a list of games won for
each team.  To get the longest winning streak, probably the "cubstreak"
function and retrosheets logs are easiest thing to use.

Anyway, get the team, total wins (including or excluding postseason,
your choice, but consistent for each year) and longest streak for
yeach year for those 5 teams for those 5 years.


2.  Make a csv file out of it it, by hand or however convenient.

3.  In Tableau, make a bar graph (or experiment with any kind of graph)
that shows the data.  You might want to multiply winning streak by
some number so that it's more visually comparable with total games --
since eeryone will wind 50-100 games but most teams will only have streaks
between 4 and 10, it might make sense to multiply streaks by 10 or 11.

See if you can demonstrate there is, or is not, a visual correlation
between the two data -- do teams with longer winning streaks tend to
win more games, based on this sample?

Later assignments, we'll gather more data, get a javascript graphing
package, and put your cubstreaks program on a web server to deliver the
data for javascript.
