When namning functions and variables, use meaningful name,
not turkey/gobbler, etc.  E.g. "def distinct_teams(filename)".
Choosing good names is difficult, but it makes it easier
to understand what the program is supposed to do.


Redo -- Assignment 1:

Write a function that gets all the tam names from a log file.
Thos are fields [3] and [4] (the 4th and 5th).  It should
return (not print) a list of strings.

Write another function that takes two log file names as its arguments.
That function should return (not print) the elements that are in one
of the lists but not the other.  You should use your first function to
do most of the work in writing the second one.

Assignment 2 -- Redo :

Write a function that takes a team log file for an argument and
returns the average score of the home team and the average runs of
the away team.  Write pseudo-code first...  you have to keep trak
of how many lines you've processed, the running totals of the home
score and of the away score, and once finished with file, divide
the running totals by number of games.

Once you have the values you can return them like:

     return (home_avg, away_avg)

Then your function can be called like so:

     ha, aa = home_away_avg("c:/tmp/gl2015.txt")
     print("home :" + str(ha) + " away: " + str(aa) )
