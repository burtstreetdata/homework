Redo -- Assignment 1:

To clarify -- you should use the function you previously wrote
that gets all the names froma log file to do this assignment.  So
likely you can just call that function twice, assign the results
to two different variables, then write a loop that builds
a new list of all the teams that are in one list and not the other.
The assignment doesn't specify whether your looking for teams
not in the first file, or teams not in the seond file:

Write a function that takes two file names, and parses them
both as game logs, and returns a list of the teams were
in the first file and not the second.

Example:

         x  =  year_team_diff("c:/tmp/gl2015.txt", "c:/tmp/gl1948.txt")

Might set x to ['MIA', 'LAD', 'MIL' ... ]

Y

---------------------

Assignment 2 -- Redo :

Write a function that takes a team log file for an argument and
returns the average score of the home team and the average runs of
the away team.  Write pseudo-code first...  you have to keep trak
of how many lines you've processed, the running totals of the home
score and of the away score, and once finished with file, divide
the running totals by number of games.

Once you have the values you can return them like:

     return (home_avg, away_avg)

Then your function can be called like:

     ha, aa = home_away_avg("c:/tmp/gl2015.txt")
     print("home :" + str(ha) + " away: " + str(aa) )

-------------------

Assignment 3:

Write a function that gets the average for the winning team of
each game.  You'll need to look on Retrosheets to find the schema that
tells you which field is which, and always remember they're off
by one -- e.g., if you parse to a list named "fields", you get
the value for the third field with fields[2]
