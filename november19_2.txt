On sunday, you copied

c:\mfsbb\msf_api.py

From GitHub.  The directory has the wrong name because I named the
repository wrong on GitHub.

You copied the contents of that file into Jupyter and they wouldn't
work -- the gave you a 400 error, which is a kind of "Not Found"

The problem was that I had "regular" mispelled in the URL.  Open
up your jupyter notebook, that has the bad code, and change "reqular"
to "regular".  Then run it.  It won't do anything on the screen, but
now if you look at

    "/tmp/pbpx.json"

It should have some size.

----------------
If that doesn't work, or any of the below doesn't work, do some self-study
using the yellow "beginning python" book, or try to troubleshoot.  Read
about "string interpolation" and "dictionary".
--------------

Now paste this into a cell and run it:

    import json
      with open(json_file,"r") as f:
      pbp = json.load(f)

Tha should assign all the play-by-play data fora  game into a variable
called pbp -- you can examine the contents of the variable by typing "pbp"
in a cell and running.

if that's all working, run this:



for b in pbp['atBats'] :
    print("Next play")
    i=0
    for p in b['atBatPlay'] :
        print ("next p")
        if('batterUp' in p.keys()) :
            pl = p['batterUp']['battingPlayer']
            print ("{} {} {}".format(pl['firstName'], pl['lastName'], p['batterUp']['result']))
        else:
            i +=1

And start reading thru the pbp data.  You see there are many "p" events
for every batter up. (pbp is "play by play" so pitches, swings, throws,
balks, etc. are all plays).

I want to work toward writing a function that will give us for each
player, how they hit under different circumstances, e.g., one-on,
two-on, three-on, no-out, one-out, two-out, ahead, behind.  

Assignment: change the code above so that it can also print out the
firstBaseRunner value for each 'pitch'.

From Sunday night:


Login to mysportsfeed; get the token

Save the token in c:\api\msf_token.api


--------------
From github, download msf_api.py:

1. make a directory called c:\msfbb
2  cd into it
run
	git clone  https://github.com/burtstreetdata/mfsbb.git

---------------


Run gitbash:

$ curl -X GET https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.0/pull/mlb/2018-regular/team_gamelogs.json?team=CHC\&date=from-20180401-to-20180430\&stats=none -u TOKENHERE:MYSPORTSFEEDS --compressed

That spits out all the games.  Hit up arrow and run it again, redirecting
to a file

$ curl -X GET https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.0/pull/mlb/2018-regular/team_gamelogs.json?team=CHC\&date=from-20180401-to-20180430\&stats=none -u TOKENHERE:MYSPORTSFEEDS --compressed > c:\tmp\april.json.txt

That gets the april schedule for the cubs into the file.  We'll use that,
in turn, to pull up play-by-play for a game.

---------------

Code to print out a schedule

import json

with open( "c:/tmp/april.json.txt") as f :
    games =json.load(f)

for g in games["gamelogs"] :
    msfid = g['game']['id']
    if(g['game']['awayTeamAbbreviation']  == 'CHC') :
        print("{}: at {}".format( g['game']['startTime'][0:10], g['game']['homeTeamAbbreviation']))
    else :
        print("{}: {} at Wrigley".format(g['game']['startTime'][0:10], g['game']['awayTeamAbbreviation']))
