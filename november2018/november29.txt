Continue working on this:

Write a python function that takes one argument, that is the name of a
Game Log file from Retrosheet and calculates three things:

   * NUmber of runs scored by Chicago for the year
   * Number of runs scored by Opponent for the year
   * Number of games won by Chicago for the year

1.  Get the number of games won by Chicago

2.  Turn it all into a function with one argument, team_abbr.... that is,
wrap it in

     def getstats (team_abbr)

3.  Now change all the hardcoded references from "CHN" to team_abbr

Test that the function works for various teams.  


4.  A function can return multiple values like this:

    	return (win_count, team_runs, oppenent_runs)

Make your function return like that.

5.  Add the ability to keep track of win streaks.  This assumes that
the log is in date order, which I think is true, and that your program
encounters the lines in date order, which is probably true.  Have it
return the longest win streek for the team it is called with.  Now
it should return 4 values.



6.  Make the function print out some kind of sensible error message
if there are no rows found for the team given as team_abbr (e.g.
if I call "def getstats ('xxx')" it could say "No such team xxx"
