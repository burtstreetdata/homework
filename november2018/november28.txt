Write a python function that takes one argument, that is the name of a
Game Log file from Retrosheet and calculates three things:

   * NUmber of runs scored by Chicago for the year
   * Number of runs scored by Opponent for the year
   * Number of games won by Chicago for the year

-----

Hints:

Dwnload from: https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html

Each game is in a zip file, each zip file has a single year.

THe "schema" is at:
    https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/glfields.txt

Field 10 and 11 are the score, visiting and home

Column 4 is the Visiting Team

Column 8 is the home team

If you read a line and then do
   fields = line.split(',')

You can get the value in column 4 with:
    fields[3]

If you have a string in a field, to use it as an integer, you
do int(fields[9])


-------

Possible pseudo code


open file and save in a chunk with realines()


set season_cub_runs 0
set season_enemy_runs 0
set cubs_wins 0
set cubs_losses 0

for each line in chunk
    are cubs in field 4 or 7 ?
    	no, continue  ("continue" skips the et of the for loop)
    set home score field 11
    set visit score field 10
    if cubs are field 4
       if visit score > home score
          cubs_win += 1
       else
          cub_lose += 1
    else
       similar
    if cubs are field 4 (visitor)
        season_cub_runs += field 10 (visitor score)
    ... etc

print

=========

Hint, first parse each line to just the variables you want,
write a test program that just does the first 2 or three lines of
the file til they come out right for home score/visitor score
which is home team.... Save it at that point.

Then modify it to only pay attention to cubs and read the whole file,
add sums, etc.
