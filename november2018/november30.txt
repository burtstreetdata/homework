Write a function that gets all the teams out of a logfie:

def team_list(logfilename):
     blah
     blah
     return list_of_names

So if I write:

   teams2016= team_list("/tmp/GL2016.txt")

I'll get the list of all the teams in that log file into my teams2016
variable.  Each team should only be listed once.


2.  Run it in a loop

    teams2016= team_list("/tmp/GL2016.txt")
    for team in teams2016 :
    	print(team)
	print seaon(team)
	print(--------------------------)
