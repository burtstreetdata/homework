1.  Write a program that uses python globbing and prints out the names of every file in c:/tmp that starts with "s".  Put some files in there that start with
s and run again, confirm it got them.

2.  Here is a progam that writes a list of players into c:\tmp\roster2018.txt.
Run it on you computer -- you can past it into a cell in das Anaconda
Navigatormeister and run -- it takes about 40 seconds:

------------------

import io
import requests
import base64
import json

def get_msf_token() :
    with open(token_directory + token_file) as tfile :
        token = tfile.read()
    return  token.strip()

token_file ='msf_token.txt'
token_directory = '/api/'
token = get_msf_token()

pullheaders={
        "Authorization": "Basic " + base64.b64encode('{}:{}'.format(token,'MYSPORTSFEEDS').encode('utf-8')).decode('ascii')
        }
pullurl = "https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.0/pull/mlb/players.json"

res = requests.get(url = pullurl, headers = pullheaders)

with open("c:/tmp/roster2018.txt", "w") as fout :
    presp = json.loads(res.text)
    for p in presp['players'] :
        player = p['player']
        fout.write (f"{player['id']}, {player['lastName']}, {player['firstName']}, {player['officialImageSrc']}\n")

----------------

After that runs, you should have a file in c:\tmp named roster2018.txt

If that doesn't work, copy from homework directory "playerlist" file into
c:\tmp\roster2018.txt

-----------------
For next problems, you can search on the web for howtos:


3.  Write a function that reads that file and counts the lines in it;
it should print "2433" (i think).

------------------------------------

4.  Write a function that reads the file and counts jus the lines
that say "None" for image.

5.  Write a function that prints out every player whose last name
begins with "Y" or "Z"

-----------------------------------

6.  search web for "python parse comma delimited" and "python string
intepretation"

Write a function that gets every line where the last name begins
with Y or Z AND has "None" for image. For each line, print out

     MLB Player <firstname> <Lastname> image

We could use that as input to make a web search for images of those
players
