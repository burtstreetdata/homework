On page 163 of workbook, do problems 10-12 (3 problems).  Before you
start, look in the back of the book to get the answers.  Show the
steps necessary to get to the answers.  Tonight we'll pretend like
I don't know how to solve them and you show me how one step at a time,
for the two most tedious ones.

On page 71 of the math drill book, do problems 10-12 (3 problems), same
thing, look in the back first, then show the steps neccesary to get to
the answer.


Trig -- two problems.  

Trig lovers' favorite circle is the unit circle and they like to make
certain triangles in it where the hypotenuse is 1.

There are only two combinations of other sides they like:

a) square root of 2 over 2  being both non-hypoteneuse sides

and

b) one side being square root of 3 over 2 and the other side being
square root of 1 over 2 (aka 1 over 2, aka 1/2)

They like to say "a squared plus b squared equals c squared" and
"the hypoteneuse of a right triangle is the square root of the sum
of the squares of its other sides."


Two two-part  problems:

a.  Suppose you had a triangle where the two non-hypoteneuse sides
were sqrt(3)/2 and 1/2.

a1) what is the sum of  (sqrt(3)/2)^2  and (1/2)^2 ?
a2) what is the sqrt of the answer you got for step a1 (hint: it is 1)


a.  Suppose you had a triangle where the two non-hypoteneuse sides
were both sqrt(2)/2

b1) what is the sum of  (sqrt(2)/2)^2  and (sqrt(2)/2)^2
b2) what is the sqrt of the answer you got for step b1 (hint: it is 1)
