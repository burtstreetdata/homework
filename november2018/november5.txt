On page 71 of the match drills book, do 1-3, 7-9 and 13-15 (total 9
problems).  Last time you did problems similar to these, you forgot
one major type of simplification.  If you wind up with something like

    3x^2  = 4x

You an divide both sides by x (so you'd have 3x = 4, and solve from
there).




Review the beginnings of the python for data science book, this is the
same material as from Friday: browse thru page 85-108.  Try typing in
some of the examples, try your own variants, etc.  Lots of data
analysis involves rows and columns of numbers, and the np.array gets
used a lot.  As you read, do the below:

Quiz:

1.  Create an numpy array x, so that if you type print(x) it prints

[[0 1]
 [2 3]
 [4 5]
 [6 7]]

2.  Use a "slice" operator on the array created above
to make a new array, newx, such that if you run "print(newx)"
you get
        [[2 3]
	 [4 5]]

3.  Use the reshape command to make an aray from x, named
flatx, such that "print (flatx)" returns:

    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]


Finally, after you've read 85-108 and done problems above, skim
thru the preceding chapter.  They give a quick review of some important
parts of python.  Without a bunch of useless nonsense no one uses.
