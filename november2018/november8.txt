1.  In python, write a function that takes no arguments and returns  555 / 48

This represents how long it takes to get to chicaco if you live
555 miles away and travel at 48 mph to get there.

2.  Write a function that takes one argument, "d", and returns
d  / 48.    This function lets you see how long it takes to get to
Chicago if you live d miles away and travel at 48 mph.

3.  Write a function takes two arguments, "d" and "r", for distance
and rate and tells you how many hours it takes to get somewhere
traveling at rate r starting d miles away.

4.  Write a function that takes three arguments, a, b and c, and
returns sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)

Test it, if b is 10, and a is 1 and c is 2, it should return
sqrt(100 -  4*1*2) == sqrt(92) -- should be more than 9 and less
than 10.

What happens if you give it values where 4*a*c is greater than b^2?

5.  Write a function to return one of the values from a quadratic
formula.  "one of the values" because the plus-or-minus logic
means for any variables a, b, and c, there are two solutions (or
zero).  The quadatic formula "fails to return a value" if 4ac
is greater than b^2


If you get stuck, search the web for answers.  Don't worry even if
it's a complete "cheat", you can search for "how do I do d/r/t
problems in python" or "python for quadratic formula"
