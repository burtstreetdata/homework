In the Structure/Method book,

on page 429, do problems 5-10 (the word problems, not the ones
on bottom of page).  These are likely to be solved most easily
by addition-or-subtracction method, not the substitution method.
(Described in preceding pages)

But you can solve whichever way seems easier.



Try this again:

Out of problem 12, make a c# program.  Make a dialog box with
4 inputs:  principal_1, principal_2 (those take money the
amount invested) and InterestRate_1, InterestRate_2.  When
values are entered, the program should give the interest per year.

E.g., if you put

      principal_1  100     interest_1  2
      principal_2  50      interest_2  6


It shoudd tell you you get $5 interest per year, by adding up

    100 * .02 ($2) and
    50 * .06 ($3)
