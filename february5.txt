More practice on systems, these should have whole number solutions:

Get the x and y value for each pair iof equations
1)

3x+5y+8 = 7
2x-2y-7 = 3


2)
8x+y-4 = 56
-2x+3y+5 = 3

3)
2x+10y+11 = 11
12x-9y-9 = 198

------------

Don't try to hurry thru, pay special attention to the signs of
operators, e.g., make sure if you subtract or add on one side,
you do the same operation on the other; with negative numbers
that's an easy mistake to make.

Rembmer also that if you need to divide by 3, for example, you
can multiply everything by 1/3, and that's usually easier.

And what we saw last night, if you have to multiply to eliminate
a fraction, make sure you multiply every expression on both sides
of equation by same amount.
