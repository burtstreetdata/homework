In the Structure/Method book,

on page 423, do problems 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12

If it's not clear how to do them, review examples on the preceding
pages.  They are all going to be substitution or subtract/add to
eliminate a variable -- they'll give you stories where you can
write two different equations inolving two variables, then either
substitute or divide.

--------------------------------------

Out of problem 12, make a c# program.  Make a dialog box with
4 inputs:  principal_1, principal_2 (those take money the
amount invested) and InterestRate_1, InterestRate_2.  When
values are entered, the program should give the interest per year.

E.g., if you put

      principal_1  100     interest_1  2
      principal_2  50      interest_2  6


It shoudd tell you you get $5 interest per year -- 100 * .02 ($2) and
50 * .06 ($3)

Later, we'll refine the program to solve a problem like the one
given in the book.
