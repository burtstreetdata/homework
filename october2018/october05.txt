1.  Using a calculator/computer make a table of points for the formula below

   3*(1-x^2)^2  - 2* (1-x^2)

(you can see it formatted better at https://imgur.com/a/iecYkiV)

Figure the values for these points:

x = .75
x = .77
x = .79
x = .81
x = .83
x = .85


2.  Graph those points

3.  Now go to https://www.desmos.com/ and see if you can get it to display the graph and confirm if your sketch matches pretty good.


4. I want to get anaconda for python 3 on your PC.

Open that anaconda window, and type "conda update anaconda" at the prompt

It should give you some choices, if not, don't worry about it, we'll try later.

If it looks like it will update you to anaconda for python 3, go ahead and
run it -- i believe we set it up with python 2.
