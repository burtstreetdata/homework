Look online at a graph of  y = x^2

Think about the slope of the line.  As you said last night, it has
infinitely many slopes -- in the case of this curve, there are no two
places where it has the same slope.  Left of x=0, slope is negative,
right of 0, it is positive.  Between about -1.5 and 1.5, the slopes
are fairly shallow, on either side they rapidly become steep.

To approximate the slope at any given point, say x = 3, we can
calculuate the y coordinate of (x^2) and (x+d)^2, then figure
out a slope by rise/run.

If d = .001, then to approximate the slope where x = 3, we would
look at two points:

     point a:   x=3,      y = 3^2
     point b:	x=3.001,  y = 3.001^2

Then divide the difference of [(3.001)^2 - 9]  by .001 (that is, divide
the rise by the run)

PROBLEMS:

1.  Using a calculator/computer, figure out the approximate slope at
of the curve using these pairs values for x:

   a.  3,  3.001
   b.  0.5,  0.50001
   c.  -2, -1.995
   d.  45, 45.02

Write down (or type in a spreadsheet) the values you get.

For each pair, you have to figure square of both numbers.  Subtract the
difference of the squares to get the rise.  Subtract the difference
of the rises. Divide by the differene of the runs.

2.  Now, we want to write a function to do this.  Start up anaconda,
and in a new cell begin definining a function

    def slope(x1, x2):


Try to write a function that squares both x and y, and returns the
value of the differenc of the squares divided by the difference of
x1 and x2.

Look online for help if you get stuck, read about python functions,
which doesn't necessarily have to involve anaconda.  However, if you
see anything about "pandas" ignore that, that's a python library
you aren't using.  For what you're doing now, it doesn't matter if you
look at stuff about python 2 or python 3.

3.  See if you can remember how to write a c# function to do this and
show the result in a form.  (optional)
