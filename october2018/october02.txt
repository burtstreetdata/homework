DO problems 13-24 on page 419.

Note, they want you to use theh substitution method (see page 418).
That means, pik one equation, and solve it for one variable, than
substitute the resulting expression for that variable.

Check your answers by plugging the answer for both variables into
both equations.  You may use a calculator/computer.  If you get any wrong,
re-do them.
