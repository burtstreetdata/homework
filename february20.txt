Take a red pen, and go thru the printout of the Nebraska 8th grade test
I left at your place (this is only pages 2-10), I left off the last couple
pages.

Circle anything in red that you don't know how to do.  There's at least
one I don't know how to do.

Then answer as much of the test as you can in an hour.
