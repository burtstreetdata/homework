Reference chapter 8 in Algebra book

Important points about systems of equations:

    5x + 3y = 18
or more generally:
    Cx + Dy = K

* Can be re-writtent as y = mx+b, just by isolating y.  So if you have
two equations, it represents two lines.  Either they are parallel or
they are the same line, or they interesect at one point.

* With systems of equations you're mostly interested in "they
interesect at one point" and the other two cases are "trick questions"
you have to recognize when they come up.

* The solution (if not the same line or parallel) represents the
  intersection of two lines.

Chapter 8 gives LONG spelled-out examples of both "substitution" and
"elimination"

Make up two equations of your own.  Choose relatively small constants,
less than 10, and choose whole number.  Solve the system of equations
both ways.   E.g., you could say

     5x - 3y = 9
     7x + 2y = 4

Then solve both ways.  It will be easier if you start out choosing a value
for x and y, e.g., x =3 and y = 4, then make up two equations like
    2*3 -5*4 = -14 . . .  2x - 5y = -14

Do two pairs of equations, solving each one by substitution and by
elimination (total of 4 problems).  Try to make some generalization
about when it's easiest to solve by substitution (I think in math
books it's more common to see ones that are easier to solve by
elimination.)


Do back exercises and go up and down stairs.
