Tableau --

Go on this site:

https://electionlab.mit.edu/data

And look for county prsidential election that
looks like this:

"year","state","state_po","county","FIPS","office","candidate","party","candidatevotes","totalvotes","version"
2000,"Alabama","AL","Cherokee",1019,"President","Other",NA,95,7823,"20181011"
2000,"Alabama","AL","Chilton",1021,"President","Al Gore","democrat",4806,15092,"20181011"
2000,"Alabama","AL","Chilton",1021,"President","George W. Bush","republican",10066,15092,"20181011"

Get just a small sample of it, and figure out what you'd need to do
to get it to be in a format similar to what the data you had for github
was -- there's no geographic data here, when you look at the two files,
is there anyway to figure out what geographic data corresponds to
Chilton County, AL?

Make some graphs showing total votes by state for Nader in 2000 -- just
bar graphs or dot graphs or something.

Spend most of the hour.

Trig

Review your flashcards for a few minutes before and after graphing.
You're trying to learn the sine and cosine of the 16 Angles of Burt Street.
Try working from both sides, too.

Dig the author's picture, too.

Read about "the sine rule" and "the cosine rule" about halfway down the page
in particular.  You don't have to do any calculations but we'll walk thru
some on odd size angles later today.
