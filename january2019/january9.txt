Trig

Radians: a radian measures the size of an angle, like a degree.  There
are 2 pi radians in a circle, about 6.3 radians.  Since there are 360
degrees in a circle, you can figure there's a bit less than 60 degrees
in one radian.

Google "how many degrees are in a radian", then, for homework, be able
to explain why there are about 60 (that is, understand and remember
the explanation above).

One thing worth mentioning: in looking at the unit circle and common
radians, you never talk about "1 radian" or "3 radians" -- the common
measures are all multiples of pi.  So 3.14159... radians is a half
circle, and 1 radian is nothing in particular -- about 2/3 of a quadrant,
about 60 degrees -- but other than knowing that rough idea of what is
the size of one radian, you don't deal with whole numbers of radians.

I left a sketch showing the sixths of radians.  Since ther are 2 pi radians
in a circle, there are 12/6 * pi radians.

Copy the sketch a couple times, but write in not just 1/6, 2/6, 3/6.... but
also (or instead) the the "normal" numbers -- e.g. 1 1/2 π, or 3π/2,
instead of 9/6 pi.

Using your sketch as a reference, do the phone app once.

Tableau

Starting with the small dataset you made lastnight (turkeys,
gobblers), import that into a new, blank workbook.  Try to make some
kind of understandable graph -- side-by-side bar charts would be
an obvious way -- letting you see the the same data, in a different
format.

25-30 minutes: Now open up the example that is formatted like the
gallery.  By looking at the GUI, and doing web searches, see if you
can change your graph (or make a new graph) sto start looking anything
like the sample.  Teams have to be the rows, and both "measures" --
FIP and ERA -- have to plot in the same graph.  I couldn't figure it
out myself, but just explore, see if you're able to get anywhere.
Start getting familiar with the terminology you see in web searches.
