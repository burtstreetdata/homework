* Tonight I'll try to remember to ask you, "how do you rewrite an
nequation lik this: 5x + 3y = 18 into y = mx+b?"  And the answer is
"isolate y".  So, to practice, how do you rewrite an equation like
this: 5x + 3y = 18 into y = mx+b?  Did you answer "isolate y"?  Good!

Make up another pair of equations, working backward -- start by
knowing the answer, e.g, x=6 and y=2.  Write two equations, both
involving the the two constant you chose, then rewrite them with "x"
and "y".

Then solve by substition.  Remember, you have to substitute into
the equation you DIDN'T start with -- if you isolve x or y in one
equation, you have to substitute back int the other equation, or
you'll just get 8=8 or simmilar.

On the yellow book of horrors, page 170, do two problems by substitution
and one by elimination

Do back exercises and go up and down stairs.  Practice answering "isolate
y"
