Tableau --

Make a new chart from teh same FIP ERA data that is a more familiar type:
vertical bars showing, for each team, their FIP in Red and their ERA in
blue


E.g., to sketch it in letters:

4.2              R
4.1  R           R
4.0  R           R
3.9  RB     B    R
3.8  RB     B    R
3.7  RB    RB    RB
3.6  RB    RB    RB   
3.5  RB    RB    RB
     Turk  Gob   Tnksgiv

R is red for ERA, B is blue for FIP, So the Gobblers have  a 3.9 FIB and
3.7 ERA in my sketch above.

Trig

Make yourself some flashcards with the sine and cosine on one side and
the radians on the other. The sine is the x-axis value and cosine is the
y-axis on the unit circle.

E.g.,  cosine of pi/3 == 1/2, sine pi/3, sine of 0 is 0, sine of pi/2 is
1

Just make it for half the circle -- top half, right half, whichever
you want.

Each card will have one value for radians and, on the other side,
two values: one for sine, one for cosine.


---------------

Python

Parse a csv file again -- parse the data file you're using for tableau
and print out a line for each that says "FIP 3.2 and ERA 3.44"

Don't worry how we did it before, just look on line and find a way
to find and format the values.
