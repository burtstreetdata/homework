Assignment 1:

Write a function that takes two file names, and parses them
both as game logs, and returns a list of the teams were
in the first file and not the second.

Example:

         x  =  year_team_diff("c:/tmp/gl2015.txt", "c:/tmp/gl1948.txt")

Might set x to ['MIA', 'LAD', 'MIL' ... ]

---------

Note that the assignment leaves a lot vague:  which should it
return, the teams not in the first file, or not in the second one?  What if
the files have teh same teams?  What if there's no such file?

When working with python interactively, you can decide as you go,
depending on what is most useful for what you are doing.

---------------------

Assignment 2 :

Write a function that takes a team log file for an argument and
returns the average score of the home team and the average runs of
the away team.  Write pseudo-code first...  you have to keep trak
of how many lines you've processed, the running totals of the home
score and of the away score, and once finished with file, divide
the running totals by number of games.

Once you have the values you can return them like:

     return (home_avg, away_avg)

Then your function can be called like:

     ha, aa = home_away_avg("c:/tmp/gl2015.txt")
     print("home :" + str(ha) + " away: " + str(aa) )
