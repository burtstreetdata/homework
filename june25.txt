Get the repository "scratchPage" from our git site onto your computer, have
it  land in c:\tmp\scratchPage.  From Ubuntu, that  directory is called
/mnt/c/tmp, and you want  to make /mnt/c/tmp/scratchPage

First, try this in ubuntu

cd  /mnt/c/tmp
git clone https://github.com/burtstreetdata/scratchPage.git

if that works, you'll  have them in c:\tmp\scratchPage.git

--------------  if that  doesn't work, figure something out from
git desktop or the github website, get  the project on your
computer.   In the long run the unix command  line one is easiest
to work with.


You'll notice that the javascript, images, and css are each in
their own directory.

Since your web browser points at c:\tmp\, you will have to
browse to "localhost:/scratchPage/" -- that will make it look
from c:\tmp\scratchPage\index.html

The images aren't in the git repository, download any three
images, put them in c:\tmp\scratchPage\images\, give them names
that match the index.html file.

So that page is an example of how javascript and css work.  Try
the tutorial at https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-sprites.php
again, modifying the pages
